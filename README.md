# doc
This Git **repository** is both the **entry point** ans the **source of truth** for the documentation of the organization’s resources.




## Documentation by Audience
This documentation is designed to cover any audiences **involved** in the **lifecycle** of any IT **projects** in the organization including business users, development teams, operations teams, and governance stakeholders:
  - from business idea to end-user needs
  - from end-user needs to business design
  - from business design to system requirements and technical design
  - from system requirements and design to development and implementation
  - from development and implementation to production operations and support
  - from production operations and support to governance loopback


Absolutely! Here's a **production-grade, smooth, and accurate** rewrite of that introductory section:

---

This documentation is designed to cover **all audiences involved in the lifecycle of IT projects within the organization**, including business users, development teams, operations, and governance stakeholders:

* from initial business requirements and design
* through development and implementation
* into production operations and support
* and up to governance, compliance, and oversight

---

This keeps it **clear, professional, and readable**, while reflecting the **full lifecycle** of IT projects.

If you want, I can also **integrate it directly with your table** for a fully polished section.
