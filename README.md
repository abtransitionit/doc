# Todo
## Questions around documentation
**how to organize the documentation**
- around type of users, readers, stakeholders

## Questions around shared terms
**Terms** historically are dedicated to one domain and can or become then **de facto** **generalized** or **specialized** (as definitions, principles, source of truth)

**ACID** and relational database
- Actions are **atomic**: done entirely or not at all.  
- System remains **consistent** after any action or failure.  
- Actions are **isolated**: one sequence does not interfere with others.  
- Effects are **durable**: once completed, changes persist or can be safely rolled back.
- **ACID** principles can now be applied to **CLI commands, API operations, CICD, and system workflows** that are **backend** by a DB or not.



### CRUD and relational databases



CRUD originates from **data persistence and record management** in relational databases, where it describes the **lifecycle of stored entities**.
* **Create**: add a new persistent entity
* **Read**: retrieve or inspect an existing entity (now is inspect, get)
* **Update** — modify, uopdate the state of an entity
* **Delete** — remove an entity from persistence
- **CRUD** principles can be applied to **CLI commands, API operations, CICD, and system workflows** that are **backend** by a DB or not.
* **CRUD** is now used as a **generic action model** to describe how any **resource or stateful object** can be managed via **CLI commands, API operations, CI/CD pipelines, and system workflows**, whether they are **backed by a database or not**.
